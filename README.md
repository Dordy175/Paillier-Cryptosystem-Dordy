# Paillier Cryptosystem Dordy
 Wolfram Mathematica notebooks with GUI for Paillier cryptosystem

Software is just for educational purposes and can not be used for any commmercial solution.

Based on Paillier Cryptosystem, this software is for demonstrating how homomorphic encryption works. IDE contains informations about all variables which are used in encryption/decryption/addition/multiplication. 

## Running Paillier-Cryptosystem-Dordy
Please note: Paillier-Cryptosystem-Dordy is using Wolfram's associated memory between notebooks and to ensure proper functionality, it is necessary to run and evaluate both notebooks. 
Recommended approach: 
- Windows: 
1. Run Paillier.bat
2. Evaluate paillierResources, evaluate paillierGUI (Wolfram -> Evaluation -> Evaluate notebook || "F8" )
- Other OS: 
1. Run paillierResources.nb, then paillierGUI.nb 
2. Evaluate paillierResources, evaluate paillierGUI (Wolfram -> Evaluation -> Evaluate notebook)

## Preview
Software is divided to 5 sections - encryption, decryption, addition, multiplication and info (info is used to echo about each operation associated with one of previous sections, main purpose of info is to show values in variables)
